      <description>Faster Than Expected I&amp;rsquo;ve been going a little faster than expected - probably because I&amp;rsquo;ve been more time than originally planned - through pwn.college. Linux Luminarium got finished on 2024-09-19, 7 days sooner than the 10 challenges/day rate I had on my original table, and it seems like Optional Refreshers will also be finished ahead of even the fastest timeline. It&amp;rsquo;s been too much fun and I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning too much to want to put it down.</description>

      <description>A Step Up I&amp;rsquo;ve completed a couple of the medium-graded picoCTF challenges so far, and it&amp;rsquo;s a noticeable step up in difficulty. Perhaps it was due to my first attempt being in my weakest category, but the knowledge base required for this level of challenge seems to be slightly beyond where I am. After switching to the &amp;lsquo;General Skills&amp;rsquo; category I had a bit better luck, but was definitely pushed harder than I was by several of the last easy challenges.</description>

      <description>Nicety Over Necessity Many of the CTF challenges have required some sort of conversion of Ordinal Position, Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal, or Binary into regular characters to either submit as a final result or be used to determine what to do next. There are online tools to do this type of thing, but I wanted to have the ability to do this offline too. With this Python tool, I can now select a translation method by typing the three letters within the parentheses - e.</description>

      <description>Easy Challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve just completed the last of the &amp;rsquo;easy&amp;rsquo; challenges in the picoCTF practice gym. It&amp;rsquo;s been a very educational and fun experience so far. While it&amp;rsquo;s unclear how much more difficult the &amp;lsquo;medium&amp;rsquo; challenges will be, the skills I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far in the easy challenges should serve as a good foundation for how they think and structure the solutions. Web Exploitation and Reverse Engineering seem to be the most challenging right now.</description>

      <description>Linux Luminarium As agreed, I would not be doing any write-ups for pwn.college because that&amp;rsquo;s against the ground rules for their generously offered free educational material. That being said, I do want to keep record of the core skills I&amp;rsquo;ve gained through each section of their course in such a way that the notes won&amp;rsquo;t take away from the challenges - because it&amp;rsquo;s in the struggling that learning really happens.</description>

      <description>Decisions After creating the timelines for pwn.college I became interested in what different completion rates would look like for picoCTF as well. For now I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to post 1 challenge per day, but it&amp;rsquo;s not often that I&amp;rsquo;ll only complete one per day. As with pwn.college, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely that &amp;gt; 5 completed per day will not be feasible, but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see what very accelerated timelines look like.</description>

      <description>pwn.college &amp;ldquo;pwn.college is an education platform for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. In martial arts terms, it is designed to take a “white belt” in cybersecurity through the journey to becoming a “blue belt”, able to approach (simple) cybersecurity competitions (CTFs) and wargames. Our philosophy is “practice makes perfect”.&#xA;The platform is maintained by an awesome team of hackers at Arizona State University.</description>

      <description>&#xD;Contemplation Deciding a realistic - but somewhat accelerated - learning rate will be important.

      <description>Challenge Count Even though they&amp;rsquo;ve just been the easy challenges so far, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning a lot from the picoCTF challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve completed. In the practice section, they have many challenges graded easy, medium, and hard available to complete. At posting one challenge write up each day, getting through the easy challenges will take me to the beginning of November, the medium challenges will take me through mid-May, and the hard challenges will take me to almost the end of July.</description>

      <description>Introduction I looked into working with PyTorch because it appears I&amp;rsquo;ll be running some machine-learning type projects in the near future, and PyTorch is a way to run that within Python - another area I&amp;rsquo;m actively expanding my skills. My hardware isn&amp;rsquo;t the strongest, so it was a question about whether I&amp;rsquo;d even meet the system requirements going in.&#xA;What is PyTorch? From their github page:&#xA;&amp;quot;PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features: - Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration - Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.</description>

      <description>Sidestepping the Roadblock&amp;hellip; While attempting to work through Git BASH yesterday to get this site set up, I got Trapped in Vim™, which is apparently a very normal experience for beginners:&#xA;After trying what felt like everything that made sense and caving in to my impatience in the moment, I closed the window and learned how to change the default editor in Git Bash and set it to nano:&#xA;git config --global core.</description>

      <description>We made it! If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, it means that the site is live. As a beginner with {blogdown}, I ran into many challenges that will likely give my later self a good laugh. Adding the .nojekyll file and adding the &amp;ldquo;publishDir: docs&amp;rdquo; line to the config.yaml seem to have done the trick in getting this live.&#xA;Now that it&amp;rsquo;s live, I need to test updating the content. My first attempt will be the following steps:</description>

      <description>Recent Realizations At the time of writing I&amp;rsquo;m only a little more than 4 months into my all-consuming focus on coding, but I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot quickly. I started my learning acceleration with a one-day, six-hour workshop with the University of Oregon data services department covering basic R in late March. The skills I learned in that workshop served as the foundation for the more powerful data processing that further amplified my primary career.</description>
